# CAVE Titles

## Mushihimesam, DoDonPachi Resurrection, and Deathsmiles

Each of these has a res and/or DISKDATA folder full of .bin files. These .bin files appear to be an archive format, as they seem to start with lists of the files they contain. Many of the files within are .TGA format graphics.

In addition, Mushihimesama and DoDonPachi Resurrection have sys360.bin files in there. These reference xbox in them, so this implies these two titles are re-ports of the Xbox 360 ports of these titles. Deathsmiles could be as well.

Assuming these are re-ports, it's highly unlikely they could be reconstituted into a valid Xbox 360 title. Even if they could be, Xbox 360 emulation is in it's infancy.

## Deathsmiles I+II
