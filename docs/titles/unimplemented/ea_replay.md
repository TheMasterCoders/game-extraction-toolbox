The BIG archive appears to be extracting properly - multiple extractors show the same results, a hand extraction looks the same, the metadata lines up and extracting netcore/netcoreadhocboot.viv yields similar results.

This strongly implies that there is a step after the BIG extraction that would transform it into a valid ROM. The resulting file from the BIG is smaller than the real ROM, so it is likely compressed and encrypted still.
